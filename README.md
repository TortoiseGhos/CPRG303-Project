# CPRG303-Project

## Status
- Proposed/Pending

## Context

- Creating an ADR for phase 2 for Fall 2024 Mobile Application Development (CPRG-303-C) project

## Decisions
- Development framework: React Native. Our team has chosen this due to our relative familiarity with it in our CPRG-303 class
- Navigation strategy: push/pop. Our team chose this due to it's common and simple nature for app development 
- Hardware: Fingerprint navigation. Our team chose this due to our project type being a Tik Tac Toe game, which needs fingerprint navigation to operate correctly
- Database storage: Local. Our team chose local storage as for the moment. Its the simplest and easist to set up

## Consequences
- **Positive consequences**: With our team choosing mostly simple structures for the entire architecture it will be relatively easy to create and upkeep
- **Negative consequences**: Lacking depth with the simplicity of the architecture could lead to road blocks in further development of the app

- **Future considerations**: We might need to change some of our decisions to best fit our app later down the line.
